## 🎨 About The Project

**TSun Age Counter** is not just another utility app; it is a statement against the generic, robotic designs flooding the web. We have crafted an experience that feels **alive**, **premium**, and **timeless**.

Gone are the boring white cards and standard inputs. Enter a world of **Glassmorphism**, **Golden Ratios**, and **Organic Motion**.

### ✨ Why TSun?
*   **Masterpiece Aesthetics**: A default theme combining deep space blues with luxury gold accents.
*   **Fluid Animations**: Elements don't just appear; they float, glide, and breathe using `framer-motion`.
*   **Smart Navigation**: A custom-built Date Picker that solves the "infinite clicking" problem of standard calendars.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎭 Dynamic Theme Engine
Switch instantly between three distinct universes, each with its own color palette, fonts, and background physics.

| Theme | Description | Vibe |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **🏆 Masterpiece** | Deep Blue & Gold | Luxury, Timeless, Royal |
| **⚙️ Steampunk** | Copper, Leather & Brass | Mechanical, Vintage, Tactile |
| **⚫ Monochrome** | Stark Black & White | High-Contrast, Swiss-Style, Minimalist |

### 🧠 Smart Date Picker
We engineered a custom `SmartDatePicker` component that allows users to:
*   Jump decades instantly via a Year Dropdown.
*   Select months quickly without scrolling.
*   Experience a seamless, glass-styled interface.
