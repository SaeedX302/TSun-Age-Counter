# Chronos: The Artisan Age Calculator

## Design Philosophy
This project has been completely reimagined to reject the "generic AI" aesthetic in favor of a **Masterpiece** design language.

### Key Features
1.  **5 Premium Themes**:
    *   **Masterpiece (Default)**: Gold & Deep Blue. Luxury, timeless, elegant.
    *   **Steampunk**: Copper & Leather. Mechanical, vintage, tactile.
    *   **Monochrome**: Black & White. Stark, high-contrast, Swiss-style.
2.  **Smart Date Picker**: We solved the "year scrolling" problem by adding a custom Year/Month selector, allowing users to jump decades instantly.
3.  **Organic Animations**: Unlike robotic, linear transitions, our interface uses `framer-motion` for fluid, physics-based animations that feel alive.

## Technical Stack
-   **Next.js 15**: For bleeding-edge performance.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For precision styling with CSS Variables for theming.
-   **Framer Motion**: For complex animation orchestration.
-   **Lucide React**: For crisp, vector iconography.

## How to Present This
When showing this to others:
-   **Show off the Themes**: "Look how the entire mood changes instantly. It's not just colors; it's the soul of the app."
-   **Demonstrate the Date Picker**: "I built a custom navigation system because scrolling back 20 years month-by-month is annoying. Good design solves problems."
-   **Own the aesthetic**: "I wanted something that felt like a luxury product, not a utility."
